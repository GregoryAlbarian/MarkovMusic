It's a fact, I'm a quack
The disgrace of the A.M.A
Cause my patients die, yeah, my patients die
Before they can pay

Like a surgeon, hey
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Got your kidneys on my mind

Like a surgeon, ooh like a surgeon
When I reach inside
With my scalpel, and my forceps, and re-tractors
Oh oh, oh oh, woe, oh
Ooh baby, yeah
I can hear your heartbeat
For the very last time

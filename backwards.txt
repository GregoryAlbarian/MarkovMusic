I was sitting on a bar stool
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this old boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me
I could tell he'd been through some hard times
There were tearstains on his old shirt
And he said you wanna know what you get
When you play a country song backwards
You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
Ya get your first and second wives back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
Your get your farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
First nite in jail with Charlie
Sounds a little crazy, a little scattered and absurd
That's what you get when you play a country song backwards
Well I never heard it said quite like that
It hit me in the face cause that's where Im at
I almost fell flat out on the floor
He said wait a minute that's not all theres even more
You get your mind back
And your nerves back
Your first heart attack back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen tv, dvd and washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn and the bail and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
It sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards
Oh play that song
Woo!!!
We sat there and shot the bull about how it would be
If we could turn it all around and change this c-r-a-p
You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
Ya get your first and second wives back
Your front porch swing
Your pretty little thing
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
Your get your farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
First nite in jail with Charlie
You get your mind back
And your nerves back
Your first heart attack back
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen tv, dvd and washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn and the bail and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
It sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards

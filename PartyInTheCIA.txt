I moved out to Langley recently
With a plain and simple dream;
Wanna infiltrate some Third-World place
And topple their regime
Those men in black with their matching suitcases;
Where everything's on a need-to-know basis;
Agents got that swagger;
Everyone's so cloak and dagger
I'm feelin' nervous but I'm really kinda wishing
For an undercover mission
That's when the red alert came on the radio
And I put my earpiece on!
Got my dark sunglasses on
And I had my weapon drawn
So I get my handcuffs
My cyanide pills
My classified dossier!
Tappin' the phones like yeah, shreddin' the files like yeah
Memorized all the enemy spies I've got to neutralize today
Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA
Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA
I've done a couple of crazy things that have almost gotten me dismissed
Like terminate some head of state who wasn't even on my list
Burn that microfilm buddy, will you
I'd tell you why but then I'd have to kill you
You need a quickie confession
Well, start a waterboardin' session!
No hurry on this South American dictator
I'll assassinate him later
That's when he walked right in my laser sights
And my silencer was on
And my silencer was on
And another target's gone!
Yeah, we've got our black ops all over the world, from Kazakhstan to Bombay;
Payin' the bribes like yeah, pluggin' the leaks like yeah;
Interrogating the scum of the earth, we'll break them by the break of day!
Need a country destabilized
Look no further, we're your guys
We've got snazzy suits and ties
And a better dental plan than the FBI's
Better put your hands up and get in the van
Or else you'll get blown away
Stagin' a coup like yeah
Brainwashin' moles like yeah
We only torture the folks we don't like
You're probably gonna be OK
